# All SQL Codes & PL/SQL Codes in one Place
Here you can find out all the solutions of the PDF given by the college for practical examination. In the `pdf` file there
are solutions written in the same page above each of the question. So use your laptop to view the query otherwise you will
not be able to even read the commands from small screen because the font size is really small for most of the queries. You can directly copy the queries from the `pdf` file and paste it to the oracle sql cli. 

Table creation commands are given but value insertion should be done from your own by using chatGPT.

To run a PL/SQL code
1. First create a file named program.sql
2. Then write the code and save the file
3. Then open `CMD` in the same directory where you have saved your program file.
4. Run `sqlplus` Enter your username and password to login to oracle database server.
5. Then write `set serveroutput on` command otherwise you will not able to see any output.
6. To run the file just put `@` then file name. Like the following one
```sql
SQL>@program
```
